Tutorial for the build-systeme of the project "Oktōmêdos".

The examples output are all in a variable
to build them all when call all.

But the "tuto" are build on demande

The user can build any of them
by asking explicitaly for an output
that have the name of one source-file
in tuto.
And it will be automatiqualy build.

The one that don't include "lib"
could use "deps". ( in the futur )
