Tutorial for the build-systeme of the project "Oktōmêdos".

The examples output are all in a variable
to build them all when call all.

But the "tuto" are build on demande
to avoid having to name all the files
in there several sub-dir
that grow constantly.
The user can build any of them
by asking explicitaly for an output
that have the name of one source-file
in tuto.
And it will be automatiqualy build.
