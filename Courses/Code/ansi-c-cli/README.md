Project name:
	ansi-c-clio
	
The gaol was to implement the following features:
- "void _print(const char * _msg)".
- "const char * _input(const char * _msg)".
- "int _atoi ( const char* str )"
- "void _itoa(int _val, char _targ[])"
- "bool _isi(char _val)"
- "bool _strisi(const char * _val)"

All with unit test examples
and an example using them all.

To have an IDE like the old one
in "99-Archive/old-setup-model"

Inspiration:

https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/atoi

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/stdlib.h/itoa

Have version already implemented and working
in the "99-Archive" for the features
and the IDE.
