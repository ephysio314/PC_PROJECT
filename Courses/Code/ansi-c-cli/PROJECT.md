A) Goal

a) General

Have step-by-step tuto
to implement and use
Command-Line-Interface
using the ansi-c language,
the stdc library
and the Linux "build-essential" package.

b) Details

Project name:
	ansi-c-clio
	
The gaol was to implement the following features:
- "void _print(const char * _msg)".
- "const char * _input(const char * _msg)".
- "int _atoi ( const char* str )"
- "void _itoa(int _val, char _targ[])"
- "bool _isi(char _val)"
- "bool _strisi(const char * _val)"

All with unit test examples
and an example using them all.

To have an IDE like the old one
in "99-Archive/old-setup-model"

Inspiration:

https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/atoi

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/stdlib.h/itoa

Have version already implemented and working
in the "99-Archive" for the features
and the IDE.

B) Structure

- Setup the IDE
- Needed sintax needed
- Needed standard library
- Implementation.
- Project.

C) Parts

a) Setup IDE

Use a Makefile and gcc
to build a serie of examples
used as tutorials.

They have access to a library
that have the implementation
we plan for.

/*
char * _input(const char * _msg);
void _print(const char * _val);
void _itoa(int _val, char _targ[]);
bool _isi(char _val);
bool _strisi(const char * _val);
*/

b) Base sintax

We have detail explaination
of the langage usage in
the implementation of the modules
and the examples.

c) standard library

Similar to the last section,
but for the standard-library feature
of stdc.

d) Implementation

Detail exaplanation of the implementation
of the modules, there unit-test.

e) Project

Detail examples that show what we can do
with those features.
