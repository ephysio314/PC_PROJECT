A) Veriation from the last example

- Move the action of creat a build directory with the docs in a separate "setup" script.

- Same for the "build" action
that was the action of asking for the executable to build.

This one was produce by another script
who have it for output.

- Add the file "DESCR.md" in the "examples" directory.
It was also use as condition from "build/examples" to call the build.
Meaning it force to setup to able the build.

Note:
	Have an implementation of copy from another thatn the root one.
