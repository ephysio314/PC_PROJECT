A) Goal

Brief explaination of the "printf" function
from the standard library <stdio.h>.

Example of integer arithmetic.

B) printf

a) Purpose

String formating was when we have a string
that contain words we change for other words.
Can be from numbers.

Show in the shell a formated string.

Is a little complex,
but able to see messages in a short-to-write way.

b) formating string

Here the formating was handle
by adding two neighbour characters.

'%' that specify that this is a formated index
and that the following
character specify the type of the input value.

c) variadic functions

For each '%' character, we should have one argument
added to the string first one.

To add an argument, append ',' and the variable or value name.

Example:
~{
char name[]="Romain";
int age=32;
float pi=3.141
printf("My name was %s.\nMy age was %d.\n%s.\nPi first four digits: %f.", name, age, "Greeting!", pi); 
}~

Can have any number of extra argument to the string.
It could also be only the string.
