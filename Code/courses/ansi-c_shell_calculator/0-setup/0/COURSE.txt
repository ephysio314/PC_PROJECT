A) Dependancies

a) Why

Need the compiler "gcc".
and the build-system "make".

b) Natif installation

On Linux for ansi-c compiler and build-system,
need "build-essential" natif package.

shell:
~{
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt clean
}~

B) Makefile

a) Usage

Will handle script to setup the environnement
and compile the app.

b) Creat make-file

Creat a file in the root directory that name "Makefile".

c) Compile using gcc

The more straigthforward was
to creat a function in the Makefile
that will directly call the command.

~{
all:
	gcc -ansi -o app.exe main.c
}~

To run it, call in the shell:
~{
make all
}~

To execute the app, run in the shell:
~{
./app.exe
}~

d) Result

The app in current "main.c" should
output in the shell ~{Hello, World!}~.

e) Later inprouve

"make" have many sintax to automate build-process.
