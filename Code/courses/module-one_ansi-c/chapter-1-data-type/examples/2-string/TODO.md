- String file-handling.

- Other string features, like

str_SubAt ( map sub-string )
str_Slice ( produce a table with element beeing sub string from separation by a symbol )
str_Cat ( like str_Cpy but conserv the old string and push after it )
str_Format ( take a sub-string as keyword,
             a sub-string as new contant,
             find all the keywords in the string and change it to be the new contant )

- Reimplement the printf function.
